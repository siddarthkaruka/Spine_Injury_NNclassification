# Spine_Injury_NNclassification
Use nearest neighbor classification to classify back injuries for patients in a hospital, based on measurements of the shape and orientation of their pelvis and spine.

The data set contains information from 310 patients. For each patient, there are: six measurements (the x) and a label (the y). The label has 3 possible values, ’NO’ (normal), ’DH’ (herniated disk), or ’SL’ (spondilolysthesis).
